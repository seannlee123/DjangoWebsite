Hello Welcome to our Django Website project.
To begin using the Django framework. You will need to Install the Python Web Framework as Django requires Python. 
To download the latest version of Python. 
Access https://www.python.org/downloads/ and select the correct OS that applies.

*Important*
Important note when downloading and setting up Python is to add to PATH. 
This will allow you to use the Python pip functions in the command line. 
PIP install link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
*Important*

=== Commmand line codes ===
In the command line you will need to input the following for Django.
1.	pip install django
2.	django-admin (to test django access subcommands)
3.	django-admin startproject “project name here”
4.	cd “project name created”
5.	python manage.py runserver (to launch server and returns http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

*Important*
Edit the INSTALLED_APPS to include your project name in ( ‘project name’, ) so that it is recognized by Django.
